abstract: >+
  In brief, RML uses a single feedforward pass to generate
  actions for each time step as if they were generated
  recurrently. It does so by stacking the input X multiple
  times along all possible previous actions a_(t-1). After generating a stacked output, a lightweight
  re-indexing step (Ï•-processing) reconstructs a trajectory
  of decisions that mirrors the recurrent process. This
  allows a direct calculation of the global reward (e.g.,
  Sharpe Ratio) with only two forward passes, rather than T
  passes in a traditional offline RRL.
